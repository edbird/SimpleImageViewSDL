# SimpleImageViewSDL
SDL Version of Simple Image View

# Keybindings
a = fix window to image size
q = quit
LEFT / RIGHT = select image from current working directory

# Why this software?
It's simple: Windows lacks a simple application to view image files. This is one of the most basic programs which would be expected to be included with any operating system. Instead of including a simple program which the user can use to view images, Microsoft has chosen to include pozzed bloatware with their operating systems. New versions of Microsoft paint take several seconds to open and load an image, which is simply not an acceptable situation for the end user.

In contrast, Simple Image View is just that - simple.

# Why SDL?
SDL probably isn't an ideal framework to use to build this kind of application, but it happened to be something that I knew how to use, and it is cross platform. Since I am a Linux developer and avoid using Windows unless absolutly necessary, I don't really know what options are available for Windows other than cross platform solutions.

Feel free to make suggestions and I can perhaps implement this differently if there is a better way.
